# Design Command

Generate or refine technical design based on requirements.

## Context
- Design focus: $ARGUMENTS
- Requirements: @docs/specs/REQUIREMENTS.md
- Existing design: @docs/specs/DESIGN.md (if exists)
- Project structure: !`tree -L 2 -I 'node_modules|.git'`

## Task
Delegate to the design architect sub-agent to create comprehensive technical design documentation and write the file directly.

The sub-agent should:
1. Read and analyze all requirements
2. Create architecture decisions
3. Define component structure
4. Specify interfaces and data flow
5. Document technology choices
6. Write the complete document to `specs/DESIGN.md`

After creating and writing design:
- Validate all requirements are covered
- Generate traceability matrix
- Check for design completeness
- Only proceed if quality gate passes
